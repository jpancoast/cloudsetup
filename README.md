cloudsetup
==========

An attempt to write some terraform (previously ansible playbooks) manifests that let you create a multi region aws setup with docker, consul &amp; vault

Current version: 0.0.1 Alpha

Some documentation here later...


devops. What should be in the devops account? build system, spinnaker. Access to all other accounts/VPC's

What should be in the other accounts? 
    kubernetes cluster
    data storage thingies

These don't really need to be separate accounts, at least for initial setup, maybe separate VPC's in the same account.
