Scripts/playbooks to do the following:
    1.  Create VPC's in separate regions with intra-VPC connectivity with:
        2+ VPC's for services, etc.
        1 management VPC that contains the following subnets:
            logging
            monitoring
            devops

    2.  Destroy those two VPC's

    3.  Launch 3 consul instances in each VPC that can all talk to each other.

    4.  Destroy all those consul instances.

    5.  Launch 3 coreos + docker instances in each VPC. Maybe have separate groups: web and middle.

    6.  Destroy coreos + docker instances.

    7.  Creae ELB's that route to web instances

    8.  Destroy those ELB's



Perhaps a python script (or scripts) that loads all inventory files and runs ansible for the all inventory files (so it would run it for us-east-1, us-west-2, all the regions. Or something.)
